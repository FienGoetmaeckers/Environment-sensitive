I tried a diagonal pattern once I think but it gave similar results and a little bit harder to process so I went back to the grids placing digs roughly 1/4 inwards of the areas corners for each corner. If all 4 digs were below 50 I resumed placing digs half way to the next one. Usually I also placed a dig in the center.
